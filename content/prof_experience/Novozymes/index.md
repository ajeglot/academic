## Introduction

Novozymes is biotechnology Danish company that is mainly focused on the research, development and production of enzymes, microorganisms and biopharmaceuticals ingredients.
During my PhD I was integrated to the a team belonging to the department of Microbial discovery. In this research department the focus is on the discovery of new microbial species, the 
identification of new enzymes and microorganisms and their characterization for potential industrial use. Therefore, both standard microbiological laboratory methods and state of the art 
molecular biology methods are used to conduct the research.


## Screening

Microbial screening is the first step in discovery. A sub sample of an environmental sample is usually plated with an adequate growth media. 
For bacterial screening the initial environmental sample could put directly on plates (R2A agar) or an enrichment culture could be initiated with the environmental sample 
before using this enrichment culture as plated material. Either way, some dilutions need to be conducted in order to limit bacterial overgrowth on the plates and enable for isolation 
of colonies. Along with the dilution, streaking techniques are used to ensure a good spread of the biological material and favor isolation of single colonies.
For fungal screening, a piece of the environmental sample is transferred to a plate (Potato Dextrose Agar for example). Then early growth of fungi must be detected to be able to isolate single fungus.
The transfer of fungus happens by cutting a small piece of the agar and transferring it to a new plate.

## Insight in a world of bacteria

Bacteria are everywhere in our environment. They inhabit our bodies and every single inch of the planet. They have evolved over the years to adapt to their environmental conditions.
There are beneficial bacteria like the ones living on your skins and protecting it from water loss and damage. And most of us have heard of the pathogenic bacteria that infect other organisms.
In bacterial research the specie E. coli is usually taken as a reference, mainly because of how easy and inexpensive it is to cultivate it in laboratories.
In my own work I did not find any of these fecal bacteria but encountered a lot of Pseudomonas species that are very common soil microorganisms.

## Parameters affecting bacterial growth

Bacteria are affected by several parameters for growth. First they need the basic nutrients for their biochemical processes including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, metals and water. 
Bacteria can be classified in many different ways based on the biochemical processes driving their catabolism (energy harvesting). For example, bacteria can be classified as aerobes (oxygen favorable) or
anaerobes (favorable to environment with absence of oxygen). Another classification can be rooted in the other chemical compounds used by the bacteria for growth, such as nitrifiers that are bacteria that use
ammonia as an energy source. Similarly, the temperature dependence of the bacteria is also used to classify them. A bacterium thriving at cold temperature (-5 to 20C) is called a psychrophile and a bacetrium thriving at high
temperature a thermophile (40 to 80C). Finally, because of health related issues such as bacterial infection we also classify bacteria as pathogenic or non-pathogenic, referring to their potential to trigger infections.
The present description is not exhaustive and only describe general classification not even referring to taxonomy.

## A world ruled by fungi

Fungi were one of the first organisms to populate the planet. They are usually very slow grower and can thrive in very harsh conditions.
Fungi possess and incredible genomes full of enzymes coding chunks. Fungi have remarkable adaptive capabilities and can be found almost everywhere.
They are actually eurkaryotes, meaning that they possess a nucleus like mammals. This also means that they are closer to humans than to bacteria in terms of evolution.
Fungi are very symbiotic organisms and many examples of collaborations in nature have been observed: with plants, with trees, with insects.

## Sequencing

At Novozymes there are many different methods used for sequencing DNA and RNA. The ones the most in use in the department where I was employed were SANGER sequencing and Illumina sequencing (NGS).
Amplicon sequencing is mainly use for taxonomic identification and it can be followed by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to determine the species more accurately and analyze the genomes for enzymes or diverse markers.
At Novozymes, the sequencing of microbes is conducted in bulk. One team is responsible for Tagmentation, which is essentially pulling together many PCR products (or samples) to make the process faster and cheaper.
These technologies are used for both fungi and bacteria similarly.
Moreover, during my PhD we developped with a colleague Lea Skov Hansen, two methods to conduct microbiome and mycobiome studies. These methods aim to give a picture of what is the bacterial and fungal distribution in a sample.
This is most often used for environmental samples. This method also allows for some kind of quantification with the inclusion of standards (blanks for contamination and samples with known concentrations for abundance quanitfication).

## Genomic studies

A genomic study starts with a question that leads to the analysis of samples. The samples can be analyzed for their DNA, cDNA, RNA. Some methods will target the identification of sequences to 
vouch for the presence and the identification of some bacteria. Other methods such as qPCR target a known sequence and provide with the abundance of it.
An ultimate tool is the metagenomics that will basically identify all the pieces in the sample to get a picture of the community. Then the relative abundance of each taxon can be determined within
the community. Similarly, metatranscriptomics target RNA instead of DNA and therefore messages from the cells. Metatranscriptomics studies provide a good picture of the actual gene transcriptions and proteins 
produced by the miroorganisms.

## Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is a growing scientific field, it is the application of computational tools to interpret biological data. More precisely, bioinformatics is the sum of methods used to understand the sequencing data.
It is used to put the pieces of the sequencing puzzle together. More and more AI softwares are developped to increase the quantity of data stored, analyzed and visualized. The methods included go from 
simply putting together a 16s rRNA sequence (15550 base pairs) to millions of sequenced nucleotides using metagenomics methods, reconstructing genomes.

## Design of experiment

After deciding the purpose of a study and defining the main questions to investigate, designing the experiment is the next step. To maximize the output of a given experiments and
ensure to be able to identify the key factors an experiment needs to be properly designed. This starts by identifying the factors influencing the process under study, then defining the use of references
(standards, reference treatments, blanks). To ensure the success of an experiment it is paramount to randomize the experiment, the order in which the sequence is conducted to minimize the effect of controlled variables.
And it is also important to make sure enough replicates are included to be able to trust the statistical analysis of the results.
