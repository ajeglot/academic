## A lifetime of volley-ball

I started playing volleyball as a kid when I was 7. I was passionnate and integrated first the departemental selection and then the regional one as one of the best youth player of the parisian region. But as a teenager I lost interests and dedicated my time to other interests.
I started again playing volley-ball when I moved to Denmark, first indoor for 4 years at the university (DTU) and Ikast Tams in Jutland. It was a lot of fun but I was called by beach-volley that I started to appreciate much more.
Eventually I played full time beach volley with even indoor beach volley practices in the winter.

## Current team

For the past 2 years (2021-2023), I have been part of the elite section of the club copenhagen beach volley (cph beach). It was a great pleasure and honor to train with this unit supported by several coaches, a physical preparator and a physiotherapist. Some of tehplayers from the danis national team practice in this unit as well. Focusing on competition and performance it really help me to improve my skillset and my physical abilities. Sadly, I got injured both years, limiting the benefit of the winter training. On the positive side, I have been able to play the competitive season every year injury free.
Last year in 2022, I ranked in the top 15 in Denmark. I had a very good time playing on the tour, travelling around the country to meet new teams.

## Coaching

During the last year, I have decided to support the growth of the club as well by coaching some teams. There are numerous teams in the club and therefore a high need for coaches. Last summer, I coached one team of men and one team of women of low levels. I focused with them on technical growth before going into game situations. This winter, I coached a tam of women which was the best level after the female elite section. It was amazing to be with great players but the potential to help for growth was reduced because of the number of players per trainings (sometimes up to 24).

## Future

I have decided to step a bit away from beach-volley and dedicated more time to other activities but beach-volley will always remain a sport that I will play at the beach.
